        <h2>Fennec Fox</h2>

        <p>
            The fennec fox, or just fennec, is the smallest fox species in the world, usually not weighing more than 3.5 lbs and not
            standing more than 8 inches tall. It can be located in the Sahara desert of North Africa, South West Israel,
            the Arabian desert, and the Sinai Peninsula. They can live up to 14 years in captivity and 10 years in the wild.

        </p>

        <p>
            Even though in animal classifications fennec foxes are considered part of the Vuples genus, some scientist argue that because
            their genes have so many distinctions between other foxes that they should be a part of their own gene pool.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aside from humans, the fennec's only main threat is the eagle owl. Becuase of their ability to jump 4 feet fowards and 2
            feet high, fennecs don't have many predators.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because a fennec fox is so well adapted for desert life, they don't need to drink water. They gain most of the water they
            consume from leaves and fruit, eggs, and other prey they eat.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not only are the fennec's ears designed for hearing prey nearby. But because their ears are extremely large, they give off
            body heat at incredibly efficient rates allowing for the fox to stay cool in the desert. Unlike other fox's and
            dog's padded feet, fennec's feet are covered in fur to prevent the hot sand from buring them.
