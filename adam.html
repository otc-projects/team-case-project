		<h2>Fennec Fox</h2>

		<p>
            The fennec fox, or just fennec, is the smallest fox species in the world, usually not weighing
            more than 3.5 lbs and not standing more than 8 inches tall. It can be located in the Sahara
            desert of North Africa, South West Israel, the Arabian desert, and the Sinai Peninsula. They
            can live up to 14 years in captivity and 10 years in the wild.
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Even though in animal classifications fennec foxes are considered part of the Vuples genus, some
            scientist argue that their genes have so many distinctions between other foxes to be a part of
            their own gene pool.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Aside from humans, the fennec's only main thread is the eagle owl. Becuase of their ability to
            jump 4 feet fowards and 2 feet high fennecs don't have many predators.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because a fennec fox is so well adapted for desert life, they don't need to drink water. They
            gain most of the water they consume from leaves and fruit, eggs, and other prey they eat.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Not only are the fennec's ears designed for hearing prey nearby. Because their ears are extremely
            large, they give off body heat very efficiently allowing for the fox to stay cool in the desert.
            Unlike other foxe's and dog's padded feet, fennec's feet are covered in fur to prevent the hot
            sand from buring them.
