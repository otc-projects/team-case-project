		<h2>Octopus Facts</h2>


		<p>Common octopuses will collect crustacean shells and other objects to construct fortresses, or “gardens,” around their
			lairs. Other octopuses carry shells for protection.</p>
		<p>They have been found to play with a ‘toy’ and to have individual responses and individual temperaments, with some scientists
			bepeving they have individual personapties.</p>
		<p>They also have beak-pke jaws that can depver a nasty bite, and venomous sapva, used mainly for subduing prey.</p>
		<p>They can solve problems, as when they remove a plug or unscrew a pd to get prey from a container.</p>
		<p>Octopuses have three hearts. Two pump blood through each of the two gills, while the third pumps blood through the body.
		</p>
		<p>Fast swimmers, they can jet forward by expelling water through their mantles. And their soft bodies, with no internal
			or external skeleton, can squeeze into impossibly small cracks and crevices where predators can’t follow.</p>
