		<h2>Elephants facts</h2>
		<!--Document from:
		https://greenglobaltravel.com/facts-about-elephants-world-elephant-day/#FACTS%20ABOUT%20ELEPHANT%20COMMUNICATION-->
		<p>Elephant skin is over an inch thick. But because it’s loaded with nerve endings, their skin is also highly sensitive. 
			Elephants from the same herd will often use touch to greet each other, either wrapping their trunks around each 
			other or giving each other friendly “hello” taps on the body.</p>
		<p>In addition to the familiar trumpet blast sound they’re known for, Elephants also purr much like cats do.</p>
		<p>Elephants are highly sensitive and caring animals. If a baby Elephant complains, the entire family will go over to 
			touch and caress it to soothe it.</p>
		<p>Elephants often pay homage to the bones of their dead, gently touching their skulls and tusks with their trunks and 
			feet. When an Elephant walks past a place where a loved one once died, it will stop in its tracks. This silent pause 
			often lasts several minutes.</p>
		<p>Elephants are highly intelligent animals, and studies have shown that they possess a variety of complex emotions and 
			feelings, including deep compassion and surprising self-awareness. Like humans, elephants have large cortexes in 
			their brains and are not born with survival skills. They have to learn these skills from older elephants in the early
			 years of their lives.</p>
		<p>Elephants have deep family bonds and tight-knit groups of related females and their offspring.  Each herd consists of
			 anywhere from 8-100 Elephants, all led by the oldest (and often largest) matriarch. When a calf is born, it’s raised
			  by the whole herd. Males usually leave the herd between the ages of 12 to 15, living solo or temporarily hanging 
			  out with other males.</p>
